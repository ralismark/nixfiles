All fortunes in this database should have an attribution that follows these
rules:

- For fiction, it should be: `<character>, "<title>" by <author>`, possibly
  without the character. Video games are similar, but can omit the author.
- For non-fiction, blog posts, and other long-form content, it should look like
  `<author>, "<title>"` or `<author>, "<title>" from <series>`. Videos also fall
  into this category.
- Man pages use `<title>(<section>) man page`.
- Comments and posts from microblogging platforms should be like `<author> on
  <platform>`.

Sources which don't (yet) have a well-defined format include:

- Overheard, or words said by individual people in real life on on a chat
  platform
- Wikipedia and other wikis
- Other official documents

I also haven't decided how additional context in these attributions work, e.g.
specifying a certain scene in a video game, or the role/hat a person is wearing
when saying something.

To specify a URL that the quote was taken from, it's done on a separate line by
prefixing the URL with `via`.

Tags like "stupid," "bad at __", "sloppy," and so on, are ways of saying
"You're performing badly and I don't know why." Once you move it to "you're
performing badly because you have the wrong fingerings," or "you're performing
badly because you don't understand what a limit is," it's no longer a vague
personal failing but a causal necessity.

Anyone who never understood limits will flunk calculus. It's not you, it's the
bug.

This "function" has a superficial similarity to unsafePerformIO but it is in
fact a malevolent agent of chaos. It unpicks the seams of reality (and the IO
monad) so that the normal rules no longer apply. It lulls you into thinking it
is reasonable, but when you are not looking it stabs you in the back and
aliases all of your mutable buffers. The carcass of many a seasoned Haskell

Klingon therapist: the battle against mental illness cannot be won decisively.
It is a long campaign against an enemy who never tires, whose forces swell to
twice their size whenever you look away. Battle against a foe of such magnitude,
who occupies your very mind... every moment you survive is a triumph against all
odds. There is no more honorable combat.

Many C++ detractors claim that the language is _inherently_ broken. That it's
_inherently_ unsafe or _inherently_ slow to compile or _inherently_ hard to fix
defects.

These are content-free statements. There is nothing _inherent_ about software.
Software does what it does, and with effort, can be made to do something new.

I have come up with a better metaphor than "you can't pour from an empty cup"
for burnout. You can't boil an empty kettle. Pouring from an empty cup just gets
you nowhere. Trying to boil an empty kettle can ruin the kettle, the stove, and
burn down your house if you keep trying it.

It turns out that the most productive hens in a coop are also the nastiest hens,
feather-pecking and cannibalizing the other hens in their coop. Because
individual hens who are the most productive are those that harm others,
selectively breeding the most productive hens can actually lead to lower overall
egg production (Muir, 2005; Wade et al., 2010).
