Tags like "stupid," "bad at __", "sloppy," and so on, are ways of saying
"You're performing badly and I don't know why." Once you move it to "you're
performing badly because you have the wrong fingerings," or "you're performing
badly because you don't understand what a limit is," it's no longer a vague
personal failing but a causal necessity.

Anyone who never understood limits will flunk calculus. It's not you, it's the
bug.

Virtue Ethics is like weightlifting. You gotta hit the gym if you want strong

want to be able to act virtuously.

Consequentialism is like firefighting. You need to set yourself up somewhere
with a firetruck and hoses and rebreathers and axes and a bunch of cohorts who
are willing to run into a fire with you if you want to put out fires.

You can't put out fires by weightlifting, but when the time comes to actually
rush into a fire, bust through some walls, and drag people out, you really
should have been hitting the gym consistently for the past several months.

This "function" has a superficial similarity to unsafePerformIO but it is in
fact a malevolent agent of chaos. It unpicks the seams of reality (and the IO
monad) so that the normal rules no longer apply. It lulls you into thinking it
is reasonable, but when you are not looking it stabs you in the back and
aliases all of your mutable buffers. The carcass of many a seasoned Haskell

utensils we needed for each of us to enjoy our meal, despite the fact that the
lovely staff here had provided enough to go around.

But after a bit of creative problem-solving, we were able to enjoy a delicious
