Tags like "stupid," "bad at __", "sloppy," and so on, are ways of saying
"You're performing badly and I don't know why." Once you move it to "you're
performing badly because you have the wrong fingerings," or "you're performing
badly because you don't understand what a limit is," it's no longer a vague
personal failing but a causal necessity.

Anyone who never understood limits will flunk calculus. It's not you, it's the
bug.

Virtue Ethics is like weightlifting. You gotta hit the gym if you want strong
muscles. You gotta throw yourself into situations that cultivate virtue if you
want to be able to act virtuously.

Consequentialism is like firefighting. You need to set yourself up somewhere
with a firetruck and hoses and rebreathers and axes and a bunch of cohorts who
are willing to run into a fire with you if you want to put out fires.

You can't put out fires by weightlifting, but when the time comes to actually
rush into a fire, bust through some walls, and drag people out, you really
should have been hitting the gym consistently for the past several months.
